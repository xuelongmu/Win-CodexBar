//! Local timezone lookup with a Windows safety shim.
//!
//! On Windows, `iana-time-zone` resolves the system zone through WinRT's
//! `Windows.Globalization` `Calendar` class. The `windows-core` activation
//! lookup caches the class factory in a process-static for the rest of the
//! process, but nothing keeps `Windows.Globalization.dll` itself loaded: the
//! notification sound/toast test group exercises COM code paths whose DLL
//! cleanup unloads it (observed empirically on this machine; which specific
//! notification API releases the DLL was not isolated). Any later
//! `get_timezone()` call then dereferences a factory vtable in the abandoned
//! mapping — a hard access violation, not a catchable Rust panic (observed
//! under LLDB: crash inside `iana_time_zone::get_timezone`).
//!
//! The fix is to load `Windows.Globalization.dll` from System32 and pin it
//! for the life of the process *before* any `iana_time_zone::get_timezone`
//! call. The attempt runs exactly once behind a `LazyLock` (OnceLock-backed):
//! every caller observes the finished result before being allowed to
//! proceed, so no thread can reach `iana_time_zone` while pinning is still
//! in progress.
