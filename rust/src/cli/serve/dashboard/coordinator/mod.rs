//! Dashboard snapshot coordinator: TTL cache + single-flight builds.
//!
//! Upstream 0.48.0 F9/#2717 parity: slow snapshot builds are NEVER discarded —
//! a build that outlives any one request still completes, its result is cached,
//! and every waiter (current or arriving mid-build) receives that same result.
//! There is no 504-style "build took too long" path at all: the only failure
//! surfaced is a build that genuinely errored, and errors are never cached —
//! but every waiter that joined the failing generation receives that same
//! stored error (the builder still reports it once), while only the NEXT
//! caller retries with a fresh build.
//!
//! Sidecar scrapes use stale-while-refresh: they return the last successful
//! snapshot immediately and only trigger an expired/missing build in the
//! background. The dashboard's [`SnapshotCoordinator::get`] contract remains
//! wait-for-fresh, with both callers sharing the same build generation.
