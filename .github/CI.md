# CI — Win-CodexBar

Win-CodexBar separates continuous validation from release signing.

- CircleCI Windows is the primary PR and protected-branch validation path.
  Its pr-check job runs scripts/local-check.ps1 -Slice ci.
- GitHub Actions Windows is the sole canonical tag-release producer. Its
  release workflow builds, signs through SignPath, verifies the signed files,
  and creates a draft GitHub Release.
- Blacksmith Windows remains a manual reserve workflow in
  .github/workflows/pr-check.yml.
- interaction-guard.yml is a lightweight GitHub-hosted policy guard.

## CircleCI validation

.circleci/config.yml contains the pr-check workflow only. Canonical release
tags are ignored by that workflow so CircleCI cannot create a competing
release build or publisher. The validation job has no GitHub release-write
credential.

The hosted PR check delegates to scripts/local-check.ps1 -Slice ci:

~~~powershell
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri run lint
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri run test:anti-slop
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri test
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri run build
node --test .github/scripts/interaction-guard.test.mjs
~~~

CircleCI's GitHub App trigger and auto-cancel settings live outside the
repository. Keep PR, default-branch, and budget rules there; do not add a
second tag trigger.

## GitHub Actions release path

.github/workflows/release.yml runs only for canonical vX.Y.Z tag pushes on a
GitHub-hosted Windows runner. It:

1. freezes the tag commit SHA and runs release preflight;
2. requires the SignPath credentials before building;
3. builds the three release artifacts;
4. uploads exactly the installer, portable executable, and CLI ZIP to GitHub
   Actions for SignPath;
5. waits for release-signing to complete;
6. verifies Authenticode on both executables and the CLI inside the ZIP;
7. emits the final six assets and manifest from signed bytes; and
8. creates or updates a draft release with the hash-safe publisher.

A signing failure stops the workflow. It cannot publish unsigned assets. The
manual signpath-test.yml workflow uses test-signing, retains its final bundle
as an Actions artifact, and never publishes a release.

The production workflow requires SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN as its only SignPath
repository secret. The organization ID, project slug, release-signing and
test-signing policy names, and codexbar-installer artifact configuration are
reviewed workflow values. Set the nonsecret Actions variable
SIGNPATH_RELEASE_CERT_THUMBPRINT after the production certificate is issued;
the finalizer rejects any signed file whose thumbprint differs.

GitHub Actions must have actions: read and contents: write for the production
workflow. The test workflow has contents: read and actions: read. SignPath
origin verification also requires the GitHub.com trusted build system to be
linked to the project and the SignPath GitHub App to have repository access.

## Budget and safety boundary

CircleCI remains the recurring Windows validation cost. The tag release path is
in GitHub Actions because SignPath verifies GitHub-hosted build provenance.
There is no parallel CircleCI tag build.

Keep the existing CircleCI budget gates, cache reuse, and auto-cancel settings.
Use the manual Blacksmith workflow only when an independent Windows result is
needed. Protect main and the canonical vX.Y.Z tag namespace.

v0.60.3 is an immutable unsigned release from before the SignPath cutover.
Do not replace its assets. The first signed release is the next normal version
after SignPath production onboarding is complete.
