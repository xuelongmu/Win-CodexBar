# Providers (Windows)

Windows rewrite of the *role* of upstream `docs/providers.md`: how providers are registered and fetched in **this** repo.
Do **not** treat upstream’s full strategy table as authoritative for Win-CodexBar without checking code — IDs and auto-order drift.

## Single factory

All shells and the CLI construct providers through:

```text
codexbar::core::instantiate_provider  →  rust/src/core/provider_factory.rs
```

`ProviderId` lives in `rust/src/core/provider.rs`. The factory match is **exhaustive** (missing arm = compile error). Tests ensure every id instantiates.

**Never** duplicate provider factories in the Tauri shell or ad-hoc commands.

## Adding a provider

1. Add a `ProviderId` variant + `cli_name` / `display_name` / cookie domain / `from_cli_name` metadata as required.
2. Implement `Provider` in `rust/src/providers/<name>/` (or module).
3. Add the match arm in `provider_factory.rs::instantiate`.
4. Keep provider-specific parsing and auth **inside** that module — no cross-provider branching in shared UI paths.
5. Keep identity / plan / email **siloed** per provider in the UI.

## Fetch strategies (concept)

Same vocabulary as upstream, implemented in Rust:

| Source label | Meaning (typical) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `auto` | Provider-specific fallback order |
| `web` | Cookie / dashboard HTTP |
| `cli` | Local CLI / PTY / RPC helpers |
| `oauth` | OAuth-backed flows where supported |

CLI: `codexbar usage --source auto|web|cli|oauth`.

Auth resolution helpers in `rust/src/providers/` commonly try: explicit settings → keyring/entry → environment variables (exact order is provider-specific).

## Cookie-backed providers

Windows browser import: Chrome, Edge, Brave (DPAPI + AES-GCM), Firefox (SQLite).  
Settings → **Providers** → provider detail → choose browser → Import.  
Manual cookie header paste is the fallback (required under WSL for Chromium DPAPI).  
Details: [COOKIES.md](./COOKIES.md).

### Replicate billing

Replicate uses the signed-in `replicate.com` session cookie for its billing
page and read-only account endpoints. Automatic mode reuses a validated local
cookie before importing the browser session; manual mode accepts a Cookie
header containing a nonempty `sessionid`. The provider reports this month's
spend and, when the optional balance request succeeds, prepaid credit balance.
It keeps those values in the cost/detail surfaces and does not invent a quota
percentage or use a Replicate API token as a website credential.

## Listing what is enabled

```powershell
codexbar config providers
codexbar config enable -p cursor
codexbar config disable -p cursor
```

Desktop: Settings → Providers (sidebar reorder, per-provider credential UI).

## Status pages

Optional status polling (provider status pages) is available via CLI `--status` and Settings advanced toggles where wired. Mapping of Statuspage vs Google incidents is provider metadata in code — see provider modules rather than upstream-only URLs if they disagree.

## Usage & Spend

Desktop tab id: `usageSpend`. The desktop and Overview consume one shared spend catalog. Codex and Claude local logs are first-class; routed OpenCodex usage enriches the matching Codex, OpenCode Go, Kimi, or DeepSeek subscription instead of appearing as a second fake provider. xAI and OpenRouter can publish exact provider-metered daily USD spend when their management credentials are configured, while Grok local sessions contribute tokens only. Missing spend sources remain unknown rather than becoming a false `$0`. Do not invent cross-currency totals.

### AWS Bedrock monitoring

AWS Bedrock is a Windows provider backed by signed Cost Explorer requests and optional CloudWatch activity. It is disabled by default, and monitoring requests can add charges to your AWS bill. AWS currently charges $0.01 per Cost Explorer API request; paginated monthly-spend reads can therefore use more than one billed request, while optional CloudWatch activity is billed under CloudWatch pricing.

The shared refresh interval controls automatic provider polling. `0` / Manual disables the recurring timer, but explicit refreshes and **Refresh when the menu opens** can still fetch Bedrock data. Disable Bedrock itself to stop its app refreshes.

`CODEXBAR_BEDROCK_BUDGET` changes only the displayed monthly progress. It does **not** cap AWS charges, stop polling, or enforce a billing limit.

Custom pricing overlays are exact-match overrides used only where the local spend contract has matching provider/model token evidence. Explicit zero rates mean free; omitted rate fields stay unknown. The Usage & Spend surface keeps provenance/coverage visible, preserves cost-only model rows when token coverage is partial, and can Copy JSON or save the same JSON contract through the native file picker.

### OpenCode, Codex quota, and local cost boundaries

OpenCode-held OpenAI/Codex OAuth can be reused for **remote Codex account quota** only when the Codex provider's `External OAuth sources` setting is explicitly enabled. Native Codex credentials still take precedence, an explicit `CODEX_HOME` stays isolated, and external credentials remain read-only. This does **not** import ordinary OpenCode sessions into Codex token or spend totals. OpenCode Go's local SQLite reader remains scoped to its own `opencode-go` assistant records; OpenAI API-platform usage is a separate provider.

### z.ai Coding Plan quotas

z.ai Coding Plans accept both `TOKENS_LIMIT` and `CREDIT_LIMIT` rows. The shortest known Coding Plan window becomes primary and the longest becomes secondary; `TIME_LIMIT` is the separate MCP lane. When absolute usage/remaining counts are available they determine the used percentage, otherwise the provider percentage is used, always clamped to 0–100%. This behavior is shared by the tray, provider detail, CLI, and other Windows surfaces.

Upstream's independent **WidgetKit** provider-widget configuration has no Windows analogue in this repository. Win-CodexBar has no WidgetKit extension; provider cards and tray entries are already independent Windows/Tauri surfaces.

## Upstream doc warning

Upstream `docs/providers.md` is a large auto-strategy matrix (60+ providers) for the macOS app. Use it as **inspiration** when porting a provider. For runtime truth on Windows:

1. `rust/src/core/provider.rs` (`ProviderId`)
2. `rust/src/providers/<id>/`
3. `codexbar usage -p <id> -v` / desktop provider detail errors
